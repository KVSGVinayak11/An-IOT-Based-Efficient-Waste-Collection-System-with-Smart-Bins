## Installation and Setup

### Hardware Setup
1. Assemble the smart bin:
   - Attach the ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to the top of the bin
   - Install the IR sensor near the bin opening
   - Mount the servo motor to control the bin lid
2. Connect the sensors and servo to the Raspberry Pi:
   - Ultrasonic sensor: 
     - VCC to 5V
     - GND to GND
     - TRIG to GPIO 23
     - ECHO to GPIO 24
   - IR sensor:
     - VCC to 3.3V
     - GND to GND
     - OUT to GPIO 27
   - Servo motor:
     - VCC to 5V
     - GND to GND
     - Signal to GPIO 17

### Software Setup
1. Install Raspbian OS on the Raspberry Pi
2. Update and upgrade the system:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```
3. Install required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install RPi.GPIO firebase-admin requests
   ```
4. Set up a Firebase project:
   - Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Set up a Realtime Database
   - Generate a private key for your service account
   - Download the JSON file containing your service account key
5. Clone the project repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iot-waste-collection.git
   cd iot-waste-collection
   ```
6. Place your Firebase service account key JSON file in the project directory
7. Update the `smart_bin_controller.py` script with your Firebase database URL and the path to your service account key file
8. Set up IFTTT:
   - Create an IFTTT account
   - Create a new applet with a Webhook trigger and an action of your choice (e.g., send an email, mobile notification)
   - Update the `smart_bin_controller.py` script with your IFTTT webhook URL

## Usage

### Running the System
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd iot-waste-collection
   ```
2. Run the smart bin controller script:
   ```
   python smart_bin_controller.py
   ```
3. The system will start monitoring the bin's fill level and detect when someone approaches the bin

### Interpreting Results
- The console will display real-time information:
  - Distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor
  - Percentage of bin capacity filled
  - Notifications when the bin lid opens or closes
  - Alerts when the bin is 80% or more full
- Check the Firebase Realtime Database to view the stored data:
  - Current fill level
  - Historical data of bin usage

### Using the Mobile Application
1. Install the mobile application on your smartphone (provide link or instructions for obtaining the app)
2. Log in using your credentials
3. The app will display:
  - Real-time fill levels of all connected smart bins
  - Notifications when bins are nearing capacity
  - Optimized collection routes based on current fill levels
4. Use the app to:
  - View bin locations on a map
  - Check historical data and trends
  - Receive alerts and notifications
  - (Add any other specific features of your mobile app)

## Future Improvements

1. Machine Learning Integration:
   - Implement predictive analytics to forecast waste generation patterns
   - Develop more sophisticated route optimization algorithms

2. Enhanced Sensor Suite:
   - Add weight sensors for more accurate fill level estimation
   - Implement odor sensors to detect potentially hazardous waste

3. Solar Power Integration:
   - Equip bins with solar panels to power the IoT devices, reducing reliance on battery changes

4. Waste Segregation:
   - Develop a multi-compartment bin with sensors to guide users in proper waste segregation

5. Blockchain Integration:
   - Implement a blockchain-based system for transparent and tamper-proof waste management data

6. Gamification:
   - Develop a reward system to incentivize proper waste disposal and recycling habits

7. Integration with City Infrastructure:
   - Connect the system with smart city platforms for better overall waste management
   - Integrate with traffic management systems for optimized collection routes

8. Expanded Mobile App Features:
   - Add augmented reality features to help users locate nearby bins
   - Implement a community forum for users to report issues or suggest improvements

9. Automated Bin Cleaning:
   - Develop a self-cleaning mechanism for the bins to maintain hygiene

10. Advanced Analytics Dashboard:
    - Create a comprehensive web-based dashboard for waste management authorities to visualize data and generate detailed reports

These improvements aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and user engagement of the IoT-based Waste Collection System, making it an even more powerful tool for smart city waste management.
